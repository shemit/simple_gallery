#### Simple Gallery ####

Provides a super easy to use, straight out of the box web gallery application. Uses /gallery to respond with a JSON object of image paths. These are then used by jQuery to load thumbnails and full images dynamically.

To test it out, simply do this:

```html
sudo node app.js
```
